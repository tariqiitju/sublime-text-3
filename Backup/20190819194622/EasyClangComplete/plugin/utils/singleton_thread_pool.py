    Whenever a job is submitted we check if there is already a job like this
    running. If it is, we try to cancel the previous job. We are only able to
    cancel this job if it has not started yet.

    Example:

    active:     ['update', 'info'] and 'update' is running.
    incoming:   'update' and then another 'update'.

    We will try to cancel the first 'update' and will fail as it is running. We
    still cancel the 'info' job as it has less priority (no need to get info if
    the translation unit is not up to date). We add a new 'update' to the list.
    Now there are two 'update' jobs, one running, one pending. Adding another
    'update' job will replace the pending update job.
