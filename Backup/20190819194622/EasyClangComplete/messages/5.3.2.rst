Version 5.3.2
=============

Documentation website ready!
----------------------------
The documentation website is live: https://niosus.github.io/EasyClangComplete/

Improvements and bug fixes:
---------------------------
- Set `use_target_compiler_built_in_flags` to "false" by default as it sometimes
  causes issues that are hard to debug on relatively simple configurations. I
  believe this should stay as a feature for advanced users that know what they
  are doing.
- Add support for upcoming clang 8.0.

Support the development!
