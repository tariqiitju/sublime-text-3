Version 5.6.0
=============

Deprecated settings:
--------------------
- `use_target_compiler_built_in_flags` removed
- `target_<xxx>_compiler` replaced by `target_compilers` setting

Improvements and fixes:
-----------------------
- New setting: `target_compilers` that replaces old `target_<xxx>_compiler` to
  streamline flag configuration
- New setting: `show_index_references` set by default to `true` used to enable
  showing symbol references when showing an info popup
- Add suffix used on Fedora to search for libclang, thanks @KingKili
- [dev] Add a test to ensure that all settings are covered in the documentation

Support the development!
