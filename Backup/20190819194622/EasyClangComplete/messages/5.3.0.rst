Version 5.3.0
=============

Improvements and bug fixes:
---------------------------
Fellow roboticists, your catkin projects now can be automatically configured!

If you're using sublime projects for your catkin projects you no longer need to
manually configure the settings. These settings should now be automatically
generated based on your workspace and the available ROS version on your system.
Sorry, but Linux only for now. If you want this functionality on other systems -
feel free to contribute!

Support the development!
